Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) Implementation

A clean, from-scratch implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN), designed to learn and generate realistic images from a random noise distribution.
📋 Project Overview

This project explores the architecture and training stability of DCGANs. By pitting a Generator against a Discriminator, the network iteratively improves until it produces plausible synthetic images.

Key Features:

    From Scratch: Implemented without high-level GAN wrappers to understand the core mechanics.

    Progressive Training: Visualizes how the model learns features over time.

    Kaggle Integration: Originally developed and trained using Kaggle's GPU accelerators (P100).

🖼️ Training Results & Progression

Note: Due to a versioning conflict within the Kaggle environment, the full continuous execution log for the final run is unavailable. However, image checkpoints were successfully retrieved every 30 epochs out of 300 to demonstrate model convergence. Total training time was around 12 hours.
